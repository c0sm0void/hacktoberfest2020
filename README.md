## Aboutüí¨
- __Manav Rachna University__ hosting an online event __Project MRU (Hacktoberfest 2020)__ brought to you by DigitalOcean in partnership with Dev & Intel ‚Äî is a month-long celebration of open-source software.
- Maintainers are invited to guide would-be contributors towards issues that will help move the project forward, and contributors get the opportunity to give back to both projects they like and others they've just discovered.

# ‚ú®No contribution is too small‚ú®

## What to do??üí™
- To earn your Hacktoberfest tee or tree reward, you must register and make four valid pull requests (PRs) between October 1-31 (in any time zone). - PRs can be made to any public repo on GitHub, not only the ones with issues labeled Hacktoberfest. 
- If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam or behavior not in line with the project‚Äôs code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.
- This year, the first 70,000 participants who successfully complete the challenge will be eligible to receive a prize.

### Choose from these tasks
#### 1. Add your name
Add your name to the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file using the below convention:

## Created sub-folders to upload/commit your code in any language or ideas.üóÇÔ∏è

## Standardsüíª
In line with Hacktoberfest value #2 (Quantity is fun, quality is key), we have provided examples of pull requests that we consider to be low-quality contributions (which we discourage).

- Pull requests that are automated (e.g. scripted opening pull requests to remove whitespace/fix typos/optimize images).
- Pull requests that are disruptive (e.g. taking someone else's branch/commits and making a pull request).
- Pull requests that are regarded by a project maintainer as a hindrance vs. helping.

Something that's clearly an attempt to simply +1 your pull request count for October.
Last but not least, one pull request to fix a typo is fine, but 5 pull requests to remove a stray whitespace is not.
